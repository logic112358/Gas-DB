## Training dataset preparation
- Prepare our Gas-DB dataset: please download in [Gas-DB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NkN1K41KmDhf3wuyi5W9UNDK1oV09xKb/view?usp=sharing).

Code will be made available soon. Stay tuned!

## An overview of our Gas-DB¬†¬†
![an overview of our Gas-DB](https://github.com/logic112358/image/blob/main/20240529155658.png)

This figure shows an overview of our Gas-DB, containing 8 kinds of scenery, containing sunny, rainy, double leakage, nearly leakage, further leakage, overlook, simple background, and complex background. The last one is the original gas image without manually annotating.

##  The comparision of the GasVid and our Gas-DB.
